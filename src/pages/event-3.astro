    <h2>Overview</h2>
    <p>
      Join us for the third event in our webinar series exploring pathways to support student learning about data and AI. This session focuses on national frameworks & recommendations that are shaping data science and AI education from K-12 through college.
    </p>
    <p>
      Three major national initiatives are providing crucial guidance for educators: the National Academies' Competencies for the Future of Data and Computing, the K-12 Data Science Learning Progressions developed by 14 national education associations, and the American Statistical Association's 2025 GAISE College Report Revision—now covering both statistics and data science for the first time.
    </p>
    <p>
      Hear directly from the leaders behind these frameworks about how they can support effective and robust teaching and learning in data science and AI.

  <h2>Featured Frameworks</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <strong><a href="https://www.nationalacademies.org/projects/DBASSE-BOSE-23-04" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine (NASEM) Competencies for the Future of Data and Computing: The Role of K-12</a></strong> – This National Academies project (and recently released report) aims to identify the foundational, flexible competencies students need in data science, AI, machine learning, and computer science — and to define the role K-12 education can play in equitably developing those competencies to prepare all students for a rapidly evolving computational landscape.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong><a href="https://datasciencelearning.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">K-12 Data Literacy and Data Science Learning Progressions</a></strong> – The K-12 Data Science Learning Progressions are a coalition-developed framework that maps how students can develop data literacy skills across five interconnected strands — from understanding the nature of data and ethical responsibilities, to collecting, analyzing, interpreting, and communicating with data — across grade levels.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong><a href="https://community.amstat.org/collegegaiserevision/home" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">ASA's 2025 GAISE College Report Revision</a></strong> – The 2025 revision of the College GAISE report updates the ASA's guidelines for undergraduate statistics and data science education — expanding beyond introductory statistics to also address introductory data science courses — with ten recommendations covering curriculum, pedagogy, and assessment.
