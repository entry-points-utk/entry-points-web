  <h2>Overview</h2>
  <p>
    How are universities building pathways for data science and AI education? This "Lessons from the Field" 
    event brings together three institutions sharing concrete examples of innovative programs spanning 
    undergraduate through graduate education.
  </p>
  <p>
    Hear directly from program leaders at North Carolina State University, Middle Tennessee State University, and the University of Tennessee, Knoxville as they discuss real-world experiences 
    launching and sustaining data science and AI initiatives. From undergraduate academies to teacher 
    preparation programs to graduate degrees, these case studies illustrate multiple entry points for 
    institutions seeking to expand data and AI education.

    >
      <p>
        Dr. Lee has been at NC State since 2000. Her research interests include teaching and learning of
        probability, statistics, and data science, especially incorporating technology use and
        designing technology environments that facilitate students’ learning. She situates her work in
        educational design in order to provide the best learning opportunities for students in K-12, her
        university students, and educators around the world that engage with her in online professional
        development.
      </p>
      <p>
        Dr. Lee was appointed to the planning committee for the National Academies convening on Foundations
        of Data Science for Students in K-12, held in Washington, DC September 13-14, 2022. At the convening
        she led a panel on issues in teacher education for K-12 data science.

      <p>
        Dr. Jones studies ways of supporting students to use mathematics and science to construct and revise
        knowledge. He has conducted research that focuses on measuring the extent to which whole class
        discussions in middle grades classrooms support students to examine epistemological aspects of various
        statistical properties, worked on interdisciplinary teams to create innovative technologies for teachers
        and students in middle grades math classes, helped to develop new tools for assessing nuanced ways of
        thinking in middle grades students, and has developed frameworks and curricular approaches for
        interdisciplinary STEM learning environments organized around data modeling practices.
