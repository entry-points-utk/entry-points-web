    <h2>Overview</h2>
    <p>
      A "Lessons from the Field" event focusing on three cases of postsecondary efforts to offer 
      programming and degree opportunities in data science and artificial intelligence. This event 
      is targeted toward higher education faculty and administrators, showcasing multiple pathways 
      to build data science and AI programs at both undergraduate and graduate levels.

      <p>
        Dr. Rachel (Ray) Levy is an award-winning writer, researcher, and educator who has
        dedicated her career to making mathematical modeling, data science, and AI belong to
        everyone. She is the inaugural executive director of the NC State Data Science and AI
        Academy and Professor of Mathematics.
      </p>
      <p>
        As the inaugural leader of the Data Science Academy, She incubates data science research
        partnerships within NC State, across NC and beyond, leads the design and implementation
        of the DSA’s ADAPT course model (All-Campus Data Science Accessible Project Based Teaching
        and Learning), and communicates about data science with national and international audiences.

    >
      <p>
        Dr. Lee has been at NC State since 2000. Her research interests include teaching and learning of
        probability, statistics, and data science, especially incorporating technology use and
        designing technology environments that facilitate students’ learning. She situates her work in
        educational design in order to provide the best learning opportunities for students in K-12, her
        university students, and educators around the world that engage with her in online professional
        development.
      </p>
      <p>
        Dr. Lee is a Distinguished University Professor of Mathematics and Statistics Education in
        the STEM Education department at NC State University. She is also a Senior Faculty Fellow at the
        Friday Institute for Educational Innovation. Her research expertise focuses on teaching and
        learning of probability, statistics, and data science in grades 4-14. She is an expert on the design
        and use of technology tools to facilitate students’ learning of mathematics and statistics, as well
        as preparing preservice and inservice teachers to teach statistics and data science (e.g., ESTEEM,
        and InSTEP), and use technology in mathematics (e.g., PTMT). In the past decade she has managed over
        7 million in funding from IES and NSF to support her research through the Hub for Innovation and
        Research in Statistics Education at the Friday Institute. She collaborates with a strong team of
        researchers and graduate students at the Friday Institute, as well as faculty, researchers, and
        technological designers at organizations such as RTI International, Research Matters Inc, University
        of Georgia, Eastern Michigan University, University of Southern Indiana, Middle Tennessee State
        University, UNC Charlotte, and Concord Consortium. Hollylynne Lee served as an RTI University Scholar
        in 2018-2019. Her current work includes developing and implementing online professional development
        to assist teachers in preparing to teach statistics and data science. See instepwithdata.org.
      </p>
      <p>
        Dr. Lee was appointed to the planning committee for the National Academies convening on Foundations
        of Data Science for Students in K-12, held in Washington, DC September 13-14, 2022. At the convening
        she led a panel on issues in teacher education for K-12 data science.
